# Real-Time-Log-Monitoring-and-Alerting-System
IWD Final Project – Data Engineering Track

This project builds a real-time data pipeline for an e-commerce platform to monitor application logs using Kafka, PySpark, Airflow, and Python. It simulates log generation, ingests streaming log data into Kafka topics, processes and filters logs with PySpark Streaming, and triggers automated alerts based on error thresholds using Python scripts. The pipeline is orchestrated and scheduled with Airflow to ensure continuous, reliable operation. This system enables real-time monitoring, timely detection of critical errors, and automated alerting, improving the platform’s operational visibility and responsiveness.
